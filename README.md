# UCIConnect HackUCI 2019
A web app that makes it easier to connect for UCI students, organizations and faculty. 

This was a colaborate project done at UCI's Hackathon event, HackUCI 2019.

In this project, I learned about and worked with HTML, Javascript, Embedded Javascript Templates (EJS), Express.js, and Node.js.
